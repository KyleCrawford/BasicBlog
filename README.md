# BlogMe
Simple Blog made using C# ASP .NET Framework 4.8 MVC with Entity Framework

Work In Progress...

This blog allows users to register an account, create and edit their own blogs, and also read all of the blogs on the website.
All visitors to the site can also view all blogs without having to create an account, but must create an account to post their own.

Commenting on peoples blogs will be added once base features are done. Must be logged in to comment.

This program was written using .NET Framework 4.8 simply because it is the last version before .NET Core (and now .NET).
Just showcasing skills related to this framework.

MVC is also a bit overkill for this simple blog. Again, this was more to show the ability to make an MVC application.
