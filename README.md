# Basic Blog
Simple Blog made using C# ASP .NET Framework 4.8 MVC with Entity Framework

Work In Progress...

This blog allows users to register an account, create and edit their own blogs, and also read all of the blogs on the website.
All visitors to the site can also view all blogs without having to create an account, but must create an account to post their own.

Registered users are able to leave comments on other posts. 

This program was written using .NET Framework 4.8 simply because it is the last version before .NET Core (and now .NET).
Just showcasing skills related to this framework.

* Note * 
This Git does include migration and database info including the admin accounts. If this project is deployed, these values will be changed.
